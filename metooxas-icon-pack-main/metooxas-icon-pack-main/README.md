# metooxas-icon-pack
A reviewed pack with assets, backgrounds, frames, laurels, and even some completed icons to help you create new icons yourself.

# Background Parts
Background parts include laurels, frames, ray effects, and the backgrounds themselves. I recommend one of each.

# Misc. Background Parts
This includes more optional parts but can come in handy when it's needed.

# Assets
The gargantuan package of hundreds of premade assets, some from the base game.

# Templates
Smart-object templates for assets like maps and flags. More in the guide.

# Backgrounds
Pre-crafted backgrounds for focus icons.

# Example Icons
These icons have been completed by me and have been selected by me as examples as to what style I try. Don't use these, please.
