### Joe Biden GFX Storage

Your fine storage of frames, backgrounds, assets, complete icons and more.

# Complete Icons and Portraits
In these, you will find complete icons and portraits you can use.

If these are used, remember to credit me somewhere, whether that be your Steam page, Discord server, in-game credit scroll, or any other easily visible place.

# Icons
This is split into four groups. Credit is not necessary for anything in these folders.

> Assets

This folder contains neat assets you can freely use, mostly made by me.

> Background Pieces

This folder contains laurels, frames, and pieces you can use to construct new frames.

> Complete Backgrounds

This folder contains freely usable backgrounds already made and ready for assets.

> Decorative Pieces

This folder contains decorative pieces to add on to your backgrounds such as banners, crosses, and more.

# Portraits
This is split into two groups.

> Templates

This folder contains cool templates that are easily usable. Credit is necessary for these items.

> Unique Backgrounds

This folder contains unique self-made backgrounds that you can use for any style.

# Templates
This is a folder containing general templates for things such as ideologies, technology icons, mod logos, and more.
